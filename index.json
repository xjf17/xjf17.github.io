Conclusion and Discussion # 4.1 Summary of Rationalism\u0026rsquo;s Development and Methods of Solving Uncertainty in Planning # As a key ideological core in planning, the development of rationalism has propelled the resolution of uncertainties in planning. Since the era of Descartes, a central idea of rationalism has been predictability and certainty, i.e., through rigorous cognition of existing laws, clearly and precisely understanding all things. However, with the evolution of rationalism, the recognition of uncertainties in the real world has gradually strengthened. Schools of thought such as bounded rationality, communicative rationality, and neo-rationalism have emerged, revising and supplementing traditional rationalist ideas. These supplements and revisions have led to a deeper understanding of planning uncertainties, while numerous experiences in planning practice have also helped to promote philosophical speculation in the field of planning and the resolution of uncertainties.\nIn summary, the development trajectory of rationalism and its corresponding planning models for solving uncertainties are shown in Table 1. Generally, the resolution of uncertainties in law cognition in planning is closely linked to advancements in other scientific tools and methods. Most theories still believe that certain laws of the city can be discovered through quantification and applied to future predictions. There is an increasing recognition of the impact of uncertainties in the discovery of laws and predictions, with a more proactive approach to finding certainties within uncertainties or reducing their impact.\nIn terms of uncertainties in planning goals, scenario planning and communicative planning, by transforming the role of planners, provide a potential platform for the determination of planning goals amidst uncertainties. Planning attempts to step down from elite politics to understand the demands of more people, which is of greater significance for higher-level social governance. This has been tried extensively in the West with relatively mature experiences, worthy of reference in China. However, it is clear that in terms of more broadly balancing interests and even understanding the potential future needs of the general public, there is still much planning can do.\nRegarding uncertainties in planning intervention, most planning models propose ways of thinking about the unknown outcomes of interventions, whether it\u0026rsquo;s provisional quantification based on what is known or starting from certain achievable tasks. These paradigms provide possibilities for solving uncertainties. Planning has gradually recognized the boundaries and control requirements of planning interventions in dealing with uncertainties.\nTable 2: Correspondence between Rationalist Thought and Planning Methods for Addressing Uncertainty\nRationalist Thought Planning Model Approximate Emergence Time Recognition and Resolution of Uncertainty in Planning Complete Rationality Blueprint Planning Pre-1940s Lack of recognition of uncertainty in urban planning Instrumental Rationality Comprehensive Planning 1950s Believes that key parts of uncertainty can be resolved rationally, future optimal solutions can be proposed through project comparison and calculation, strict implementation ensures future state Systems Planning 1950s Planning can form multiple developmental cross-sections through dynamic adjustments, which reflect development laws Quantitative Prediction Models 1950s Simulates urban laws quantitatively, predicts future development, addresses cognitive uncertainty Bounded Rationality Incremental Planning (Continuous/Discontinuous) 1960s Addresses uncertainty in intervention, focuses on solving current limited real issues, future uncertainties are not a primary concern Mixed-Scanning Model 1970s Utilizes long-term decisions of comprehensive planning, including micro, current limited issues Scenario Planning 1990s Acknowledges cognitive uncertainty, scenario simulation to reduce intervention uncertainty, provides a possible platform for uncertain planning goals Communicative Rationality Communicative Planning 1980s Solves goal uncertainty through multi-party communication, facilitates implementation to reduce intervention uncertainty Neo-Rationalism Complex Adaptive Systems 1990s Summarizes existing cognitive uncertainty and explains its causes, emphasizes the city\u0026rsquo;s self-organization capabilities, values the combination of bottom-up and top-down planning 4.2 Implications for Urban Planning in China # 4.2.1 Understanding: Coexistence of Certainty and Uncertainty # Summarizing historical experiences in dealing with uncertainties, it should be recognized that certainty and uncertainty will coexist in the planning process for a long time. Urban planning needs to first accept the general laws of complex system cognition and control intervention on the level of understanding and have a reasonable prediction of uncertainties. Existing planning in China often relies on population and land-use scale predictions as the basis for subsequent schemes, showing a linear decision-making mindset of prediction upon prediction, which undoubtedly lacks recognition and response to uncertainties. In the planning compilation process, it is necessary to actively consider and attempt to address uncertainties, even starting from the uncertainties of the future in planning, shifting from the original elite decision-making status, combined with the role of the government, to become decision consultants, public participation leaders, and other roles.\n4.2.2 Methodology: Multi-perspective Theoretical Frameworks in Planning Formulation, Implementation Management, and Social Governance # Faced with numerous historical methods for solving uncertainties, China\u0026rsquo;s planning can attempt to draw from their excellent experiences. However, in addition to recognizing the approaches and models of these methods for solving uncertainties, it\u0026rsquo;s also important to acknowledge the core issues they addressed in their era. Facing the more diverse and complex current urban situation, planning needs to incorporate multiple frameworks to comprehensively consider decisions.\nIn the past decades of development, rationalism\u0026rsquo;s understanding has gradually become a consensus in China\u0026rsquo;s planning. However, on the one hand, the strong mindset of instrumental rationality has led to inadequate recognition and response to the complexity of cities and uncertainties in planning. On the other hand, in government decision-making, the rational understanding of planning is considerably lacking, with uncertainties becoming an excuse for unscientific or even meaningless planning. It should be recognized that some plans are already transitioning towards bounded and communicative rationality, but the practices are still quite insufficient. It is imperative to involve multi-perspective theoretical frameworks such as the mixed-scanning model, scenario planning, and communicative planning in the formulation, implementation management, and especially in the process of social governance.\n","date":"22 December 2023","permalink":"/posts/%E7%90%86%E6%80%A7%E4%B8%8E%E4%B8%8D%E7%A1%AE%E5%AE%9A%E6%80%A73/","section":"Posts","summary":"4.","title":"Summary and Implactions——Rationalism in Recognizing and Responding to Uncertainty in Urban Planning (3)"},{"content":"","date":"22 December 2023","permalink":"/","section":"XIE JINFENG","summary":"","title":"XIE JINFENG"},{"content":"\r3. Rationalism\u0026rsquo;s Response to Planning Uncertainty # As the emergence and development of planning ideas often present a spiraling upward state, and many ideas and methods have appeared in the early stages of planning, undergoing several generations of updates and corrections, this paper mainly summarizes the background of rationalism that led to these ideas and the specific methods used to respond to uncertainty. The chronological order of this paper roughly follows the stages of Western planning thoughts in the 20th century as divided by Wu Zhiqiang and Qiu Baoxing [9,10], and appropriately combines and condenses them according to the development of uncertainty.\nFrom the early 20th century to before World War II, urban planning generally lacked recognition of uncertainty. Although urban planning had moved beyond the excessive pursuit of urban forms and patterns, it still believed that the future of cities was predictable, controllable, and changeable to a large extent. Most planners thought that the task of urban planning was to draw a beautiful blueprint, detailing a wonderful vision of the city in several years, and believed that the realization of the blueprint could be accomplished through technical means [11]. The recognition and exploration of uncertainty mainly occurred after the 1960s, hence this paper focuses on the period from the 1940s to the early 21st century.\n3.1 Initial Recognition of Uncertainty through Instrumental Rationality: Comprehensive Planning, Systems Planning, and Quantitative Analysis # 3.1.1 Instrumental Rationality\u0026rsquo;s Recognition of Uncertainty # The concept of instrumental rationality was first proposed by the Frankfurt School in Germany in the 1940s, emphasizing the driving role of science, technology, and tools on social culture and art [12]. Weber further suggested that instrumental rationality solves the problem of maximizing benefits, but in this process, actions pursuing moral, cultural, and value goals are ignored, i.e., value rationality is neglected [13].\nFrom after World War II to the 1960s, systems theory, information theory, and control theory saw significant development, marking an important climax of instrumental rationality. Its research and application scope moved from natural sciences to humanities and social sciences, significantly influencing urban planning thought and methods. Systems theory indicated that urban problems require a systematic approach to study the current status, development changes, and relationships of various elements [10]. Although cities are random and uncertain, their laws are not completely unknowable or uncontrollable. Information theory suggested that general laws of urban development could be explored through methods like measurement and simulation [14]. Control theory provided methods for guiding planning on how to control this complex system and reduce uncertainty after decision-making [11]. Against this background, planning attempted to adopt a path of \u0026ldquo;defining goals and problems, proposing solutions, and evaluating and comparing solutions\u0026rdquo; [15], and planning models such as comprehensive planning, systems planning, and procedural planning began to emerge.\n3.1.2 Initial Understanding of Uncertainty Based on Instrumental Rationality # Comprehensive planning is a typical product of instrumental rational thought, attempting to solve the problem of uncertainty in planning intervention by comprehensively evaluating the impact of each project, calculating a series of weights and impact factors, and selecting the most beneficial solution. Its scope of study has far exceeded the previous period\u0026rsquo;s material form and focused on a larger whole. Geddes proposed the three-stage theory of \u0026ldquo;survey-analysis-plan\u0026rdquo; in methodology. In 1968, the UK replaced the original development plan and master plan with institutional planning and local planning through legislation [14].\nSystems planning further views urban planning as a dynamic adaptive process. Planning is no longer a final blueprint-style but a process-oriented one, requiring regular adjustments according to the system\u0026rsquo;s operation at different times, thus forming multiple cross-sections of different developmental states. Planning can monitor, analyze, and intervene in this process [3]. This cross-sectional analysis method analyzes the important characteristics and general laws in the process of uncertainty.\nClearly, although comprehensive and systems planning both acknowledge the uncertainty of the future, they both believe that the uncertainty in planning, or at least the uncertainty in the parts concerned with urban planning, can be eliminated through control and intervention, and these key parts will have a predictable impact on other parts. Instrumental rationality, while firmly believing in rational and effective future decision control, concretely provided two types of planning models to reduce uncertainty and propose the best future solutions.\nConcurrent with these planning practices were numerous attempts to apply scientific analytical methods to quantitatively study urban laws, addressing the uncertainty in city cognition, but with limited success. Methods like comprehensive forecasting, mathematical models, and computer simulations were used to analyze the operating laws within the city system, attempting to fully quantify and simulate predict the future development path [14]. Some models about cities were also proposed, like Christopher Alexander\u0026rsquo;s notion of the city as a \u0026ldquo;semi-lattice structure\u0026rdquo; of multiple intertwined and overlapping aspects [14]. These approaches clearly contain a strong flavor of instrumental rationality, attempting to completely comprehend the general laws of the city through calculation, later proving that cities always have parts that are difficult to quantify and predict. However, it is undeniable that although cities cannot be fully quantitatively understood – now a part of the consensus in academia – these attempts and ideas were and still are of considerable positive significance for the cognition of cities.\nThe above planning epistemologies and solutions in response to uncertainty began to be questioned and criticized in the late 1960s. On the one hand, comprehensive planning and systems planning did not truly solve the uncertainty in urban cognition. The completely rational planning model requires a comprehensive examination of related factors and comparison of various schemes, which is almost impossible to complete in actual operation, still leaving a large amount of uncertainty in planning formulation. The preparation of planning took a long time, with the average preparation time for a plan in the UK once exceeding four years [15], making the lengthy and complex planning process lose flexibility and less favorable in practice for solving uncertainty.\nOn the other hand, the above planning models struggled to answer objective questions about planning goals and the effects of planning intervention. Their criterion of \u0026ldquo;public interest\u0026rdquo; for maximum benefit evaluation was vague and even substituted in actual operation. Neo-Marxism pointed out that when planners, as social elites, make decisions, they often become spokespersons for capital and politics under the guise of \u0026ldquo;science\u0026rdquo; [15]. In implementation, the comprehensiveness of planning included too many tasks and requirements, becoming a comprehensive plan for social development, far beyond the control range of planning departments, turning \u0026ldquo;comprehensive\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;systematic\u0026rdquo; into mere paper visions.\n3.2 Bounded Rationality\u0026rsquo;s Response to Uncertainty: Incremental Planning, Mixed-Scanning Approach, and Scenario Planning # 3.2.1 Theoretical Background of Bounded Rationality # With the development of rationalism, there has been a growing recognition of the uncertainties in the real world, leading to the emergence of schools of thought that offer corrections, including bounded rationality. This school reflects on the certainty of rationality, asserting that individuals, constrained by real-world conditions, cannot possess complete and sufficient rationality. The concept of bounded rationality, first introduced in decision-making research, was brought forth by Herbert Simon, who highlighted the presence of value judgments in decision-making as a characteristic of bounded rationality, indicating that uncertain decisions are widespread [7]. Alongside the critique of comprehensive and systems planning, bounded rationality gradually shifted the focus of planning to decision-making behaviors, operational planning, and the achievement of planning goals under real-world constraints [3]. On this basis, planning approaches such as incremental planning, mixed-scanning models, and scenario planning were developed.\n3.2.2 Planning Methods Under Bounded Rationality to Address Uncertainty # In 1959, Charles Lindblom, addressing the limitations of comprehensive planning in terms of time, finances, and information, which hindered reliable predictions and achievements, proposed \u0026ldquo;disjointed incrementalism\u0026rdquo; in planning, also known as \u0026ldquo;separate-incrementalism.\u0026rdquo; This approach defines realistic and limited objectives within the uncertainties of the future and uses limited schemes to solve current practical problems [16]. In 1973, Branch proposed the theory of continuous urban planning, revising disjointed incrementalism and suggesting that urban planning is a process. Planning issues can be classified into certain and uncertain, thereby determining the planning timeframe [3]. Compared to Lindblom’s theory, continuous urban planning emphasizes continuous actions and outputs, with the belief that uncertainty can be partially resolved through a continuously developing process. That is, each small, short-term decision is relatively certain, and a roughly continuous direction can potentially reduce future uncertainties.\nBoth types of planning modes focus more on what can be done at present, showing a relatively passive attitude towards future uncertainties. In 1967, Etzioni combined disjointed incrementalism with comprehensive planning, proposing the mixed-scanning approach [17], which coordinated comprehensive planning framework with separate incremental actions, encompassing both macro-strategic and micro-execution levels.\nScenario planning, which emerged during the same period, is a planning mode specifically aimed at addressing uncertainty, focusing on solving uncertainties in planning cognition and intervention. Scenario planning adopts a mindset oriented towards future scenarios, deducing development pathways from key elements, and representatively describing future city events and trends [18]. Unlike comprehensive planning, scenario planning discusses future plans but focuses on effective mechanisms for responding to potential future situations, not on the precise determination of plans. Moreover, scenario planning moves beyond extrapolation from historical data, instead exploring key factors in urban development from various information sources.\nThe framework of scenario planning involves complex classifications and possibilities (Figure 1), which are not elaborated in detail in this paper but only discussed in terms of their approach to solving uncertainties. In general, scenario planning addresses uncertainties on three levels: first, it acknowledges cognitive uncertainty and categorizes the known and unknown. After defining key elements, it discusses possible scenarios in a way that combines subjective and objective approaches, rather than relying solely on extrapolation from the current situation. Second, it reduces uncertainty in planning intervention through scenario simulation. Scenario-based adaptive planning models test and vet existing strategies through multiple scenarios, while generative strategies in scenario models optimize intervention decision-making by influencing decision-makers\u0026rsquo; experiential perspectives [8]. That is, although the future is uncertain as a whole, influencing the choice of intervention decisions by delineating a few relatively certain causal chains. Third, it provides a potential platform for resolving uncertainty in planning goals. The simplicity and choice of scenario models allow planners to move from the position of decision-makers or drafters to \u0026ldquo;decision consultants,\u0026rdquo; enabling multiple parties, including the public and government, to make joint decisions based on existing scenarios. This effectively avoids unilateral decisions and the pursuit of short-term interests or grand appearances [8]. Overall, scenario planning offers a relatively rational cognition and targeted solutions for the uncertain characteristics of planning and continues to be widely used in formulating major strategies.\n3.3 Communicative Rationality\u0026rsquo;s Response to Uncertainty: Communicative Planning # 3.3.1 Theoretical Background of Communicative Rationality # Another school of thought that revises instrumental rationality is communicative rationality, which posits that rationality is a common human nature and needs to be understood through reasonable communication and analysis of contemporary social relationships to grasp the scale of rational judgment [19]. Communicative rationality directly addresses the issue of uncertainty in planning goals, suggesting that goal determination can be achieved through communication among subjects, i.e., rationality manifested in interpersonal interactions. This idea gradually entered the field of planning in the 1980s and significantly altered the role and task definition of planners. Planners shifted from being decision aids influencing urban development to mediators among different interest groups, with the core task of planning turning towards balancing multiple interests and seeking common goals.\n3.3.2 Planning Methods Under Communicative Rationality to Address Uncertainty # Communicative planning is an important paradigm of communicative rationality applied in planning. It establishes the rationality of planning on the collective effort of subjects, where planning is the pursuit and establishment of consensus, achieved through discussions and debates [3]. This effectively resolves the issue of uncertainty in planning goals. While it includes many specific ideological branches, most emphasize equality in the planning decision-making process, without expert privilege or marginalization of weaker groups. The quality of planning should be measured by the planning process, where a good plan should fully reflect democratic values, and the significance of the process outweighs the importance of the planning results [20].\nCommunicative planning also indirectly reduces the uncertainty of planning intervention. Through comprehensive discussions among various parties, planning decisions often become more direct and specific. In the framework of communicative planning, communities and constructors may even consider details like facades and window sills [21], promoting identification and support for the project by various groups, making the intervention process smoother and subject to broader supervision during implementation.\n3.4 Neo-Rationalism\u0026rsquo;s Reconsideration of Uncertainty: Complex Adaptive Systems Theory # The important scientific theoretical foundation for the emergence of neo-rationalism is the \u0026ldquo;complex adaptive systems\u0026rdquo; theory, evolved from \u0026ldquo;dissipative structures,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;mutation theory,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;synergetics.\u0026rdquo; The former three further advanced the understanding of uncertainty in cities, recognizing the imbalance, mutation, and high complexity of cities. Complex adaptive systems theory further points out the significant \u0026ldquo;bottom-up\u0026rdquo; balance characteristics of cities: First, cities can \u0026ldquo;self-renew\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;self-evolve\u0026rdquo; by processing information and extracting laws about the objective world from experience. Second, the collective decision-making of cities is an adaptive result after considering external environments and development goals, meaning cities have \u0026ldquo;self-adaptive\u0026rdquo; capabilities. Third, cities have a symbiotic and co-evolutionary relationship with surrounding societies and natural environments [22]. The theory of complex adaptive systems, compared to earlier views, emphasizes more on micro-individuals and the collective laws formed by them, proposing a \u0026ldquo;bottom-up\u0026rdquo; intervention approach and the capacity for public self-organization in dealing with urban uncertainties.\nStrictly speaking, research in complex science has mostly guided urban planning at the epistemological level and has not yet established a complete planning model. Existing practices, such as smart cities and twin cities [23], adaptive simulation in traffic planning [24], and attempts in social governance [25], often involve recognizing and revising related issues within the framework of existing planning models. In terms of planning decision-making, the paths of simulation and public participation brought by complex adaptive systems theory are more about providing references for decision-making rather than intervening in the decision-making itself. It can be said that although complex adaptive systems theory provides a feasible path for building city models with lower uncertainty [26] and efficient public participation, due to current limitations in value recognition and technical methods, planning has not yet produced an effective response.\n","date":"21 December 2023","permalink":"/posts/%E7%90%86%E6%80%A7%E4%B8%8E%E4%B8%8D%E7%A1%AE%E5%AE%9A%E6%80%A72/","section":"Posts","summary":"3.","title":"Rationalism's Response to Planning Uncertainty——Rationalism in Recognizing and Responding to Uncertainty in Urban Planning (2)"},{"content":"Abstract: There has been considerable discussion in the history of planning about the problem of uncertainty in planning, leading to a series of excellent ideas and methods.

Introduction # Urban planning has played a crucial role in guiding and driving urban construction and development in China over the past decades. However, planning often faces the embarrassing situation of being \u0026ldquo;ineffective\u0026rdquo; when confronting the uncertainty of future urban development and related demands within the city. Some scholars have even pointed out that general plans are always \u0026ldquo;outdated,\u0026rdquo; and control plans often \u0026ldquo;uncontrollable\u0026rdquo; [1]. However, the recognition of uncertainty in urban planning has a long history, and a series of solutions and methods have been developed. Summarizing the outstanding ideas and methods from history for solving uncertainties in planning is significant for understanding the uncertain characteristics of cities as complex systems and addressing these uncertainties.\nAmong the many philosophical reflections on solving urban uncertainties, rationalism, as one of the most important core ideas in modern urban planning theory, has always played a significant role in recognizing and addressing the phenomenon of urban uncertainty. Rationalism, as the cornerstone of modern philosophy and science [2], has been integral to the development of modern urban planning theory and methodology, even dominating Western planning theory and practice at one point [3]. Rationalism has evolved from the Cartesian era\u0026rsquo;s demand for clear and precise cognition of laws to the recognition of uncertainty through bounded rationality and communicative rationality, and into the new century with the proposal of neo-rationalism. This evolution corresponds to the shift in urban planning from ignoring uncertainties to recognizing and passively responding to them, and then to a decision-making approach that encompasses tolerance and active intervention.\nIn summary, this paper discusses the evolution of thought and intervention methods in planning when facing the complex and uncertain system of the city, from the perspective of rationalism\u0026rsquo;s recognition of and response to uncertainty, providing positive references and implications for future urban planning in China.\n2. Recognition of Uncertainty in Planning # To clarify the content and framework of the analysis, this article first categorizes the uncertainty in planning into three aspects: uncertainty in the cognition of urban laws, uncertainty in urban planning goals, and uncertainty in urban planning intervention. The uncertainty in law cognition highlights the inherently indeterminate characteristics of cities, representing the uncertainty of the decision object. In contrast, the latter two focus on the decision-making and implementation processes in planning, representing the uncertainty of the decision subject.\n2.1 Uncertainty in the Cognition of Urban Laws # The city is a complex, open mega-system and an adaptive system. The laws governing its system development include uncertainties. This uncertainty in law cognition can be further divided into three parts: Firstly, the insufficient understanding of existing laws. The complex system has numerous laws, and discovering, verifying, and mastering these laws require appropriate tools and methods. Our current understanding of urban laws is still quite insufficient, and even the tools and methods needed to discover these laws are not mature enough. This uncertainty can be reduced or even eliminated through continuous research and discovery of urban laws.\nSecondly, the limited predictability. Complex science indicates that rapidly changing mega-systems do not always have inevitable and regular development paths [4]. Complex systems are highly sensitive to initial conditions, so they often only allow for short-term behavior predictions, not long-term outcomes [5]. The long-term development of cities is currently unpredictable in scientific theory, representing an insurmountable uncertainty.\nThirdly, instability. The development process of cities inevitably experiences sudden changes. Large events, major projects, and significant shifts in city decisions can lead to significant deviations from the original development trajectory, causing substantial discrepancies between planning forecasts and actual development. These sudden and imbalanced changes are often unpredictable in planning, and the uncertainty brought about by instability will persist for a long time.\n2.2 Uncertainty in Urban Planning Goals # The primary source of uncertainty in urban planning goals lies in the guiding values and related policies of planning at the formulation and implementation levels. John Friend pointed out the need to solve coordination problems among different decision-makers\u0026rsquo; policies in planning, requiring consensus among all parties to implement strategic methods [6]. Peter Hall further noted that many uncertainties in the planning environment stem from uncertain guiding values or policies [7]. In China\u0026rsquo;s planning system, there are often conflicting planning goals between the planning subject government and planning objects like the market and stakeholders. The failure to clearly coordinate these conflicts makes the planning\u0026rsquo;s value orientation unclear, leading to a plan that is \u0026ldquo;uncertain for whom it is made,\u0026rdquo; ultimately encountering resistance in implementation and difficulty in gaining acceptance.\nAdditionally, the value orientations of planning subjects and objects often change with the planning context, making the value consensus reached during planning formulation different from that during implementation. The lag in spatial intervention means that space inevitably lags behind actual needs, turning the planning goal into a hypothetical rather than a real target. For example, London had a positive assessment of the economic development brought by the Olympics when bidding for the Games, and planned accordingly. However, the economic downturn during the actual Olympics turned the event into a burden rather than an ideal vision for the government departments [4]. Such changes in goals are common in today\u0026rsquo;s rapidly developing world, and obviously, the overall social development changes far exceed the predictive scope of planning.\n2.3 Uncertainty in Urban Planning Intervention # The uncertainty in planning intervention is first reflected in the limited nature of decision-making information. In the context of the dispersion and complexity of social knowledge, it is almost impossible for decision-makers to consider all influencing factors cost-effectively in a neoclassical rational calculation [8], making the planning decision basis always incomplete and limited. Consequently, it is difficult for decision-makers to make entirely certain judgments during intervention decisions, leading to a tendency among some government decision-makers in China to opt for relatively short-sighted decisions or decisions based on subjective preferences.\nThe uncertainty of intervention is also reflected in the complexity of its impacts. On the one hand, it is difficult to fully anticipate all the results of planning intervention in the city. The complexity of the city means that an intervention often yields results entirely unforeseen in the initial planning phase, and in some cases, results contrary to expectations. On the other hand, it is difficult to ascertain the effectiveness of the intervention. In the implementation of planning, the planning intervention\u0026rsquo;s lack of involvement in the approval and implementation process involving multiple parties and balancing interests can lead to significant differences between the implementation results and the ideal expectations, even causing the implementation of the overall urban planning intention to face difficulties.\n","date":"20 December 2023","permalink":"/posts/%E7%90%86%E6%80%A7%E4%B8%8E%E4%B8%8D%E7%A1%AE%E5%AE%9A%E6%80%A7/","section":"Posts","summary":"Abstract: There has been considerable discussion in the history of planning about the problem of uncertainty in planning, leading to a series of excellent ideas and methods.","title":"Recognition of Uncertainty in Planning——Rationalism in Recognizing and Responding to Uncertainty in Urban Planning (1)"},{"content":"","date":"9 December 2023","permalink":"/categories/blogs/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Blogs"},{"content":"In the evolution of urban and rural planning, changes in planning technology undoubtedly offer a significant perspective for viewing the history of the discipline. The technical methods of urban and rural planning serve as crucial bridges in transitioning from conceptual values and strategic concepts to practical implementation. These methods are used to intervene in various processes within urban and rural development. There has been considerable thought on the technological evolution of urban and rural planning. Yin Zhi, from an international perspective, believes that the technical methods of urban and rural planning have undergone five evolutionary stages: \u0026ldquo;physical planning, empirical planning, integrated planning, continuous planning, and comprehensive environmental planning.\u0026rdquo;\nThis article posits that the technological evolution in China is characterized by \u0026ldquo;multiple approaches and multi-dimensional exploration.\u0026rdquo; On one hand, China entered rapid urbanization later than Western developed countries. The vast differences in urbanization across different regions, combined with the advantages of being a later developer and regional disparities, have led to simultaneous learning from different developmental experiences of the West in various regions, especially after the reform and opening up. The influx of numerous schools of thought has greatly diversified the practice of urban and rural planning in China. On the other hand, due to the unique characteristics of China\u0026rsquo;s socialist market economy, urban and rural planning in China has been continuously exploring its development path, experimenting with various dimensions and techniques suitable for China\u0026rsquo;s national conditions.\nSpecifically, the technical methods of urban and rural planning are gradually transitioning from traditional static methods to multi-dimensional dynamic calculations. This shift moves from relying on static data such as yearbook statistics and field observations to dynamic, multi-dimensional models based on economics and informatics. The focus has shifted from a form-dominated approach to a comprehensive consideration of economic, social, and ecological aspects. This involves broadening the spatial concept, transitioning from directive management to regulatory and institutional management in intervention methods, and shifting the value orientation from comprehensive spatial arrangement to respecting the natural laws of urban development and encouraging diverse participation in the urban and rural planning process.\nBased on the study and analysis of the technological evolution, this article proposes three considerations for the development of the urban and rural planning discipline:\nChina\u0026rsquo;s urban and rural planning technology is becoming more systematic, showing a spiral upward development. However, behind this technological evolution lies an insufficient understanding of urban laws. The theoretical and technical methods used to intervene in urban development are increasing in variety. From the initial blueprint-style general planning learned from the Soviet Union to the gradually systematized scale-based planning and management system (such as \u0026ldquo;master plan-area planning-control planning-revision planning\u0026rdquo;), China has accumulated experience in controlling urban development through planning. Despite some mistakes and detours, the overall trend has been upward. However, it\u0026rsquo;s critical to recognize that the established urban planning and management systems, based on technical methods, are not founded on a comprehensive understanding of urban development laws and mechanisms. The basic understanding of complex urban systems is still lacking, and the cognitive methods are insufficient. For example, the determination of population numbers in general plans, floor area ratio in detailed control plans, and the specific relationship between urban infrastructure, service population, and spatial layout are still lacking rigorous technical support. The management and platform attributes of technology are strong, but the scientific and falsifiable nature of the content produced by technology is weak. Urban and rural planning should not be limited to this but should aim to build a city knowledge community centered on urban space, which is the core of the technological evolution of urban and rural planning, not dominated by administrative power or practice-based requirements. Otherwise, planning may become a mere public management discipline, losing its spatial core.\nThe evolution of urban and rural planning technology reflects the expansion of disciplinary groups and research backgrounds, a necessary path for the development of complex urban system sciences. However, it\u0026rsquo;s important to understand the relationship between these disciplines and urban planning in the field of urban studies. Throughout the history of urban and rural planning, disciplines such as sociology, economics, geography, public administration, computer science, and public health have joined the large academic system studying complex urban systems. Each expansion of this disciplinary group brings new perspectives to urban and rural planning, providing tools and methods for understanding and intervening in cities. The understanding of cities has shifted from a purely spatial and physical problem to a holistic and complex issue centered on people. In the large field of urban research and management, urban planning currently occupies a relatively central position. It should be recognized that urban planning and other disciplines are equal in studying and understanding urban laws. The discoveries of each discipline about urban laws and mechanisms should be valued equally. In many professional fields, without the intervention of specialized disciplines, urban planning alone would be an empty shell. For example, the study of healthy cities cannot do without knowledge from the field of public health, and the study of large-scale human activities in cities still relies on computer science. However, because of the practical and applied nature of urban and rural planning, this discipline can intervene in cities based on the overall results of the disciplinary group, not just a single discipline. This is part of the value of urban and rural planning technology. In intervening in the physical space of the city, disciplines used in navigation, public reviews, shared bicycles, and non-planning social policies are changing space through their impact on human behavior. As a people-centered discipline, urban and rural planning should always maintain an open and, more importantly, equal attitude in urban research and management.\nThe process of technological evolution and the stages of social development are closely related to changes in decision-making methods. In the future, the role and value of urban and rural planning as a discipline should be dialectically viewed against the backdrop of technological development and social governance structures. Due to the policy nature of urban and rural planning, planning inevitably becomes a manifestation of decision-making methods: the top-down decision-making of the planned economy era brought about blueprint-style general planning. Since 2000, discussions on elite politics and scientific development have led to a series of strategic plans, such as the Guangzhou Strategic Plan. In the subsequent process of citizenization, the wave of participatory planning has gradually risen. Government proposals for city operation and institutional design in the face of urban renewal and spatial production reflect the gradual adjustment of planning in response to decision-making methods.\nRegarding the role of urban planning, some suggest that decisions made by urban planners are not as effective as those made by local government leaders, even when based on research. The author agrees that making a relatively optimal decision in a short time in the face of complex issues is an important manifestation of the decision-maker\u0026rsquo;s management and decision-making abilities, but this capability is based on the decision-maker\u0026rsquo;s position and the comprehensiveness of the information they possess. Some believe that the role of the planning discipline is not to be a decision-maker but an advisor and important executor for decision-makers. If so, this advisor is not unique and whether it is the main one depends on the broader development context.\nTherefore, what planning should ultimately form is not a discipline and technical framework that satisfies the intentions and requirements of a specific project, but a framework that realizes public interest through space. It should be an advisor and executor for the government in maximizing public interest through spatial means, not an advisor and executor for all spatial issues. In this framework, on one side is the market, which will not contribute more to the public interest than necessary but is highly dependent on important public goods. On the other side is the government, whose lack of understanding of the market and difficulty in judging development issues may lead to decisions that go against public interest at a specific time and place, or may temporarily overlook local interests for the sake of overall benefits. Planning should make adjustments and strike a balance in these scenarios. From this perspective, the problems solved by decision-makers\u0026rsquo; intuitive decisions and the problems that planning needs to solve are not the same. China has been under top-down management for thousands of years, leading to a decision-making mode in planning based on intuition. As the social governance structure becomes increasingly diversified, the public and spatial attributes of planning are important competitive advantages in the new era.\n","date":"9 December 2023","permalink":"/posts/three_thoughts/","section":"Posts","summary":"In the evolution of urban and rural planning, changes in planning technology undoubtedly offer a significant perspective for viewing the history of the discipline.","title":"Three Thoughts on the Evolution of Urban and Rural Planning Discipline from the Perspective of Planning Technology"},{"content":"To better understand the construction status and development requirements of rural areas in China, the Rural Revitalization Center at Tsinghua University initiated the CRCS program.

This paper focuses on the informal economy of night markets. Through questionnaire surveys and in-depth interviews with three representative types of night markets in Hangzhou, this paper explores the measures for informal economy governance. Firstly, the night markets are analyzed in three dimensions: order, vitality and inclusiveness. It is found that after long-term governance, Hangzhou night markets have acquired the characteristics of the formal economy, such as spatial stability and standardized operation, as well as the characteristics of the informal economy, such as people-friendly, vitality and low barrier to entry, and a trend of diversification has emerged. Secondly, we summarize the governance model of multi-entity collaboration and transformation of three types of typical night markets, and conclude the governance strategies such as differentiated rent setting, refined contractual constraints and flexible time and space utilization.

Applying the rent gap theory, the paper breaks down the land rent gap into four components: depreciation rent gap, development rent gap, rule rent gap, and scenario rent gap, with the latter being a novel concept inspired by Clark\u0026rsquo;s scenario theory. The paper also examines the causes, characteristics, and dynamics of various rent gaps in urban regeneration, and explains the rationale behind market players\u0026rsquo; choice between demolition-redevelopment and micro-regeneration. Using Langyuan Vintage Cultural and Creative Industrial Park and Tianzifang area as cases, the paper analyses the patterns of rent gap changes in the regeneration process. It argues that future urban regeneration requires a healthy and sustainable multiple rent-gap structure. In addition, the paper suggests that scenario rent gap should be valued, the possibility of incentivizing the realization of scenario rent gap with regular rent gap should be explored to enhance the momentum of micro-renewal, and institutional support should be provided to promote the sustainable increase of scenario rent gap.\n在存量规划的背景下，探讨在城市有限增量甚至是减量要求下更新的动力来源，推动城市存量空间更新能够 以良性可持续的方式发展，是城市更新中极为重要的课题。基于租差理论，将传统的土地租差分解为折旧租差、发展租差、规则租差和场景租差等 4 个部分，形成多元租差的解释框架。其中，创新地在克拉克的场景理论基础上提出场景租差概念。基于多元租差框架，梳理各类租差的成因、特点及在城市更新中扮 演的动力角色，进一步解释市场主体对 拆除重建式更新与微更新的选择逻辑。 以“朗园 Vintage”文创产业园和田子坊 地区为例，通过案例分析总结其更新过 程中租差变化的规律。提出：在未来的城市更新中要形成良性可持续的多元租 差结构；重视场景租差效益，探索以规则租差激励场景租差实现的可能性，提升微更新动力；提供自上而下的制度保障，促进场景租差的持续增长。\nKeywords # multiple rent gap; urban renewal; scenario rent gap; Langyuan Vintage; Tianzifang\n多元租差；城市更新；场景租差；“朗园 Vintage”；田子坊\n查看原文\n","date":"1 March 2023","permalink":"/publication/rentgap/","section":"Publication","summary":"Abstract # Under the requirement of limited or even negative urban land increment, understanding the motivations for urban regeneration and promoting sustainable regeneration practices constitute crucial issues in the contemporary planning studies.","title":"Reinterpretation of the Dynamics of Urban Renewal Based on Multiple Rent Gaps: Taking Langyuan Vintage and Tianzifang as Examples"},{"content":"\rArticle which is not for Publishment \u0026amp; Thinking and Findings\r","date":"13 June 2022","permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"\rArticle which is not for Publishment \u0026amp; Thinking and Findings\r","title":"Posts"},{"content":"\rResearch Project\r","date":"13 June 2022","permalink":"/project/","section":"Project","summary":"\rResearch Project\r","title":"Project"},{"content":"\rPublications on the article\r","date":"13 June 2022","permalink":"/publication/","section":"Publication","summary":"\rPublications on the article\r","title":"Publication"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"}]
